# Project-1_Fear-Setting





This is a project that integrates multiple server-side APIs and aims to solve a real world problem. Amidst the current pandemic there are a lot of individuals who are faced with daily fears. This application aims to create a safe space where an indvidual can face their fears and aim to overcome them. The application will reward the action of facing a fear by generating a positive quote and an entertaining Giphy when a fear task is completed.
